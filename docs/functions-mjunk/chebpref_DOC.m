%% CHEBPREF :: Abstract class for Chebfun system preferences.
%    CHEBPREF is an abstract class for managing preferences of the various
%    subsystems comprising Chebfun.  On its own, it provides little more than a
%    wrapper around a MATLAB struct.  Concrete preference classes inherit from
%    CHEBPREF and add to its functionality as desired.
