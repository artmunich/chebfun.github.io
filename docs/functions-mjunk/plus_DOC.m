%% + :: CHEBFUN plus.
%    F + G adds CHEBFUNs F and G, or a scalar to a CHEBFUN if either F or G is a
%    scalar.
% 
%    H = PLUS(F, G) is called for the syntax 'F + G'.
% 
%    The dimensions of F and G must be compatible. Note that scalar expansion is
%    _not_ supported if both F and G are CHEBFUN objects.
