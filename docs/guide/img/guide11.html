## 11.1  What is a chebfun2?

Chebfun2 is the part of Chebfun that deals with functions of two variables defined on a rectangle $[a,b]\times[c,d]$. Just like Chebfun in 1D, it is an extremely convenient tool for all kinds of computations including algebraic manipulation, optimization, integration, and rootfinding. It also extends to vector-valued functions of two variable, so that one can perform vector calculus.

A chebfun2, with a lower-case "c", is a MATLAB object, the 2D analogue of a chebfun. The syntax for chebfun2 objects is similar to the syntax for matrices in MATLAB, and Chebfun2 objects have many MATLAB commands overloaded. For instance, `trace(f)` returns the sum of the diagonal entries when $f$ is a matrix and the integral of $f(x,x)$ when $f$ is a chebfun2.

Chebfun2 builds on Chebfun's univariate representations and algorithms.  Algorithmic details are given in [Townsend &amp; Trefethen 2013b].

The implementation of Chebfun2 exploits the observation that many functions of two variables can be well approximated by low rank approximants. A rank $1$ function is of the form $u(y)v(x)$, and a rank $k$ function can be written as the sum of $k$ rank $1$ functions. Smooth functions tend to be well approximated by functions of low rank. Chebfun2 determines low rank function approximations automatically by means of an algorithm that can be viewed as an iterative application of Gaussian elimination with complete pivoting [Townsend &amp; Trefethen 2013]. The underlying function representations are related to work by Carvajal, Chapman and Geddes [Carvajal, Chapman, &amp; Geddes 2008] and others including Bebendorf [Bebendorf 2008], Hackbusch, Khoromskij, Oseledets, and Tyrtyshnikov.



## 11.2 What is a chebfun2v?

Chebfun2 can represent scalar valued functions, such as $\exp(x+y)$, and vector valued functions, such as $[\exp(x+y);\cos(x-y)]$. A vector valued function is called a chebfun2v, and chebfun2v objects are useful for computations of vector calculus. For information about chebfun2v objects and vector calculus, see Chapters 14 and 15 of this guide.



## 11.3 Constructing chebfun2 objects

A chebfun2 is constructed by supplying the Chebfun2 constructor with a function handle or string. The default rectangular domain is $[-1,1]\times [-1,1]$. (An example showing how to specify a different domain is given at the end of this chapter.) For example, here we construct and plot a chebfun2 representing $\cos(xy)$ on $[-1,1]\times[-1,1]$.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(x,y) cos(x.*y));
plot(f), zlim([-2 2])</pre><img src="img/guide11_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

There are several commands for plotting a chebfun2, including `plot`, `contour`, `surf`, and `mesh`.  Here is a contour plot of $f$:

<pre class="mcode-input">contour(f), axis square</pre><img src="img/guide11_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

One way to find the rank of the approximant used to represent $f$ is like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">length(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
     7
</pre>Alternatively, more information can be given by displaying the chebfun2 object:

<pre class="mcode-input">f</pre><pre class="mcode-output">f =
   chebfun2 object: (1 smooth surface)
       domain                 rank       corner values
[  -1,   1] x [  -1,   1]        7     [0.54 0.54 0.54 0.54]
vertical scale =   1 
</pre>The corner values are the values of the chebfun2 at $(-1,-1)$, $(-1,1)$, $(1,-1)$, and $(1,1)$, in that order. The vertical scale is used by operations to aim for close to machine precision relative to that number.



## 11.4 Basic operations

Once we have a chebfun2, we can compute quantities such as its definite double integral:

<pre class="mcode-input">sum2(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   3.784332281468732
</pre>This matches well the exact answer obtained by calculus:

<pre class="mcode-input">exact = 3.784332281468732</pre><pre class="mcode-output">exact =
   3.784332281468732
</pre>We can also evaluate a chebfun2 at a point $(x,y)$, or along a line. When evaluating along a line a chebfun is returned because the answer is a function of one variable.

Evaluation at a point:

<pre class="mcode-input">x = 2*rand - 1; y = 2*rand - 1;
f(x,y)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.925580699869090
</pre>Evaluation along the line $y = \pi/6$:

<pre class="mcode-input">f(:,pi/6)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   chebfun row (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length   endpoint values  
[      -1,       1]       11      0.87     0.87 
Epslevel = 8.096942e-15.  Vscale = 1.000000e+00.
</pre>There are plenty of other questions that may be of interest.  For instance, what are the zero contours of $f(x,y) - .95$?

<pre class="mcode-input">r = roots(f-.95);
plot(r), axis square, title('Zero contours of f-.95')</pre><img src="img/guide11_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

What is the partial derivative $\partial f/\partial y$?

<pre class="mcode-input">fy = diff(f,1,1);
plot(fy)</pre><img src="img/guide11_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

The syntax for the `diff` command can cause confusion because we are following the matrix syntax in MATLAB. Chebfun2 also offers `diffx(f,k)` and `diffy(f,k)`, which differentiate $f(x,y)$ $k$ times with respect to the first first and second variable, respectively.

What is the mean value of $f(x,y)$ on $[-1,1]\times[-1,1]$?

<pre class="mcode-input">mean2(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.946083070367183
</pre>

## 11.5 Chebfun2 methods

<pre class="mcode-input">help chebfun2/max2</pre><pre class="mcode-output"> MAX2   Global maximum of a CHEBFUN2.
    Y = MAX2(F) returns the global maximum of F over its domain. 
    
    [Y, X] = MAX2(F) returns the global maximum in Y and its location X.
 
   This command may be faster if the OPTIMIZATION TOOLBOX is installed.
  
  See also MIN2, MINANDMAX2.

</pre>

## 11.6 Object composition

So far, in this chapter, chebfun2 objects have been constructed explicitly via a command of the form `chebfun2(...)`. Another way to construct new chebfun2 objects is by composing them together with operations such as `+`, `-`, `.*`, and `.^`. For instance,

<pre class="mcode-input">x = chebfun2(@(x,y) x, [-2 3 -4 4]);
y = chebfun2(@(x,y) y, [-2 3 -4 4]);

f = 1./( 2 + cos(.25 + x.^2.*y + y.^2) );
contour(f), axis square</pre><img src="img/guide11_05.png" class="figure" alt="">



## 11.7 Analytic functions

An analytic function $f(z)$ can be thought of as a complex valued function of two real variables, $f(x,y) = f(x+iy)$. If the Chebfun2 constructor is given an anonymous function with one argument, it assumes that argument is a complex variable. For instance,

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(z) sin(z));
f(1+1i), sin(1+1i)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
  1.298457581415977 + 0.634963914784736i
ans =
  1.298457581415977 + 0.634963914784736i
</pre>These functions can be visualised by using a technique known as phase portrait plots. Given a complex number $z = re^{i\theta}$, the phase $e^{i\theta}$ can be represented by a colour. We follow Wegert's colour recommendations [Wegert 2012], using red for a phase $i$, then yellow, green, blue, and violet as the phase moves clockwise around the unit circle. For example,

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(z) sin(z)-sinh(z),2*pi*[-1 1 -1 1]);
plot(f)</pre><img src="img/guide11_06.png" class="figure" alt="">

Many properties of analytic functions can be visualised by these types of plots, such as the location of zeros and their multiplicities. Can you work out the multiplicity of the root at z=0 from this plot?

At present, since Chebfun2 only represents smooth functions, a trick is required to draw pictures like these for functions with poles [Trefethen 2013]. For functions with branch points or essential singularities, it is currently not possible in Chebfun2 to draw phase plots.
