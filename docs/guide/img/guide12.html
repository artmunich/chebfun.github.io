## 12.1  What is a chebfun2?

Chebfun2 is the part of Chebfun that deals with functions of two variables defined on a rectangle $[a,b]\times[c,d]$. Just like Chebfun in 1D, it is an extremely convenient tool for all kinds of computations including algebraic manipulation, optimization, integration, and rootfinding. It also extends to vector-valued functions of two variables, so that one can perform vector calculus.

For example, here is a test function that has been part of MATLAB for many years.  MATLAB represents the "peaks" function by a $49\times 49$ matrix:

<pre class="mcode-input">peaks</pre><pre class="mcode-output"> 
z =  3*(1-x).^2.*exp(-(x.^2) - (y+1).^2) ... 
   - 10*(x/5 - x.^3 - y.^5).*exp(-x.^2-y.^2) ... 
   - 1/3*exp(-(x+1).^2 - y.^2) 
 
</pre><img src="img/guide12_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

The same function is available as a chebfun2 in the Chebfun2 gallery:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = cheb.gallery2('peaks');
plot(f), axis tight, title('Chebfun2 Peaks')</pre><img src="img/guide12_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

Of course in Chebfun we can do all sorts of things with functions to high accuracy, such as evaluate them

<pre class="mcode-input">f(0.5,0.5)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.375375578848318
</pre>or compute their maxima,

<pre class="mcode-input">max2(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   8.106213589442334
</pre>A chebfun2, with a lower-case "c", is a MATLAB object, the 2D analogue of a chebfun. The syntax for chebfun2 objects is similar to the syntax for matrices in MATLAB, and Chebfun2 objects have many MATLAB commands overloaded. For instance, `trace(A)` returns the sum of the diagonal entries of a matrix $A$ and `trace(f)` returns the integral of $f(x,x)$ when $f$ is a chebfun2.

Chebfun2 builds on Chebfun's univariate representations and algorithms.  Algorithmic details are given in [Townsend &amp; Trefethen 2013b] and mathematical underpinnings in [Townsend &amp; Trefethen 2014]. For more information, see Section 12.8.



## 12.2 What is a chebfun2v?

Chebfun2 can represent scalar-valued functions, such as $\exp(x+y)$, and vector-valued functions, such as $[\exp(x+y);\cos(x-y)]$. A vector-valued function is called a chebfun2v, and chebfun2v objects are useful for computations of vector calculus. For information about chebfun2v objects and vector calculus, see Chapters 15 and 16 of this guide.



## 12.3 Constructing chebfun2 objects

A chebfun2 is constructed by supplying the Chebfun2 constructor with a function handle or string. The default rectangular domain is $[-1,1]\times [-1,1]$. (An example showing how to specify a different domain is given at the end of this chapter.) For example, here we construct and plot a chebfun2 representing $\cos(2\pi xy)$ on $[-1,1]\times[-1,1]$.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(x,y) cos(2*pi*x.*y));
plot(f), zlim([-2 2])</pre><img src="img/guide12_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

There are several commands for plotting a chebfun2, including `plot`, `contour`, and `surf`.  Here is a contour plot of $f$:

<pre class="mcode-input">contour(f), axis square</pre><img src="img/guide12_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

One way to find the rank of the approximant used to represent $f$, discussed in Section 8.8, is like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">length(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
    11
</pre>Alternatively, more information can be given by displaying the chebfun2 object:

<pre class="mcode-input">f</pre><pre class="mcode-output">f =
   chebfun2 object: (1 smooth surface)
       domain                 rank       corner values
[  -1,   1] x [  -1,   1]       11     [   1    1    1    1]
vertical scale =   1 
</pre>The corner values are the values of the chebfun2 at $(-1,-1)$, $(-1,1)$, $(1,-1)$, and $(1,1)$, in that order. The vertical scale is used by operations to aim for close to machine precision relative to that number.



## 12.4 Basic operations

Once we have a chebfun2, we can compute quantities such as its definite double integral:

<pre class="mcode-input">sum2(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.902823333580281
</pre>This matches well the exact answer obtained by calculus, which is $(2/\pi)\hbox{Si}(2\pi)$:

<pre class="mcode-input">exact = 0.9028233335802806267957003779</pre><pre class="mcode-output">exact =
   0.902823333580281
</pre>We can also evaluate a chebfun2 at a point $(x,y)$, or along a line. When evaluating along a line a chebfun is returned because the answer is a function of one variable.

Evaluation at a point:

<pre class="mcode-input">x = 2*rand - 1; y = 2*rand - 1;
f(x,y)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.553360839574910
</pre>Evaluation along the line $y = \pi/6$:

<pre class="mcode-input">f(:,pi/6)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   chebfun row (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length   endpoint values  
[      -1,       1]       21     -0.99    -0.99 
Epslevel = 1.776357e-15.  Vscale = 1.000000e+00.
</pre>There are plenty of other questions that may be of interest.  For instance, what are the zero contours of $f(x,y) - .95$?

<pre class="mcode-input">r = roots(f-.95);
plot(r), axis square, title('Zero contours of f-.95')</pre><img src="img/guide12_05.png" class="figure" alt="">

What is the partial derivative $\partial f/\partial y$?

<pre class="mcode-input">fy = diff(f,1,1);
plot(fy)</pre><img src="img/guide12_06.png" class="figure" alt="">

The syntax for the `diff` command can cause confusion because we are following the matrix syntax in MATLAB. Chebfun2 also offers the more easily remembered `diffx(f,k)` and `diffy(f,k)`, which differentiate $f(x,y)$ $k$ times with respect to the first first and second variable, respectively.

What is the mean value of $f$ on $[-1,1]\times[-1,1]$?

<pre class="mcode-input">mean2(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.225705833395070
</pre>

## 12.5 Chebfun2 methods

## 12.6 Composition of chebfun2 objects

So far, in this chapter, chebfun2 objects have been constructed explicitly via a command of the form `chebfun2(...)`. Another way to construct new chebfun2 objects is by composing them together with operations such as `+`, `-`, `.*`, and `.^`. For example,

<pre class="mcode-input">x = chebfun2(@(x,y) x, [-2 3 -4 4]);
y = chebfun2(@(x,y) y, [-2 3 -4 4]);

f = 1./( 2 + cos(.25 + x.^2.*y + y.^2) );
contour(f), axis square</pre><img src="img/guide12_07.png" class="figure" alt="">



## 12.7 Analytic functions

An analytic function $f(z)$ can be thought of as a complex-valued function of two real variables, $f(x,y) = f(x+iy)$. If the Chebfun2 constructor is given an anonymous function with one argument, it assumes that argument is a complex variable. For instance,

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(z) sin(z));
f(1+1i), sin(1+1i)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
  1.298457581415977 + 0.634963914784736i
ans =
  1.298457581415977 + 0.634963914784736i
</pre>These functions can be visualised by using a technique known as phase portrait plots. Given a complex number $z = re^{i\theta}$, the phase $e^{i\theta}$ can be represented by a colour. We follow Wegert's colour recommendations [Wegert 2012], using red for a phase $i$, then yellow, green, blue, and violet as the phase moves clockwise around the unit circle. For example,

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(z) sin(z)-sinh(z),2*pi*[-1 1 -1 1]);
plot(f)</pre><img src="img/guide12_08.png" class="figure" alt="">

Many properties of analytic functions can be visualised by these types of plots, such as the location of zeros and their multiplicities. Can you work out the multiplicity of the root at $z=0$ from this plot? For another example, try `cheb.gallery2('airycomplex')`.

At present, since Chebfun2 only represents smooth functions, a trick is required to draw pictures like these for functions with poles [Trefethen 2013]. For functions with branch points or essential singularities, it is currently not possible in Chebfun2 to draw phase plots.



## 12.8 Chebfun2 low rank approximations

Chebfun2 exploits the observation that many functions of two variables can be well approximated by low rank approximants. A rank $1$ function, also known as _separable_, is of the form $u(y)v(x)$, and a rank $k$ function is one that can be written as the sum of $k$ rank $1$ functions. Smooth functions tend to be well approximated by functions of low rank. Chebfun2 determines low rank function approximations automatically by means of an algorithm that can be viewed as an iterative application of Gaussian elimination with complete pivoting [Townsend &amp; Trefethen 2013]. The underlying function representations are related to work by Carvajal, Chapman and Geddes [Carvajal, Chapman, &amp; Geddes 2008] and others including Bebendorf [Bebendorf 2008], Hackbusch, Khoromskij, Oseledets, and Tyrtyshnikov.

Here is an exampled adapted from [Townsend &amp; Trefethen 2013] and `cheb.gallery2('smokering')`. The function $$ f(x,y) = \exp( -40(x^2-xy+2y^2 - 1/2)^2) $$ has the shape of an elliptical ring in the unit square, and Chebfun2 represents it by an approximation of reasonably high rank:

<pre class="mcode-input">ff = @(x,y) exp(-40*(x.^2 - x.*y + 2*y.^2 - 1/2).^2);
f = chebfun2(ff);
levels = 0.1:0.1:0.9;
contour(f,levels)
title(['rank ' int2str(length(f))],'fontsize',12)</pre><img src="img/guide12_09.png" class="figure" alt="">

To illustrate the nature of low-rank approximations, rather than letting Chebfun2 determine the rank adaptively, we can force it to take ranks $1,2,\dots ,9$.  Here are the results, plotted with black level curves at heights $0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8$:

<pre class="mcode-input">levels = 0.2:0.2:0.8;
clf
for k = 1:9
    axes('position',[.03+.33*mod(k-1,3) .67-.3*floor((k-1)/3) .28 .28])
    contour(chebfun2(ff,k),levels,'k'), axis off
end</pre><img src="img/guide12_10.png" class="figure" alt="">

For this function, "plotting accuracy" is achieved approximately at rank 16; the remaining terms are then required to get from 2-3 digits to 15.
