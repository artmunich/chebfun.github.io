## 14.1 Zero contours

Chebfun2 comes with the capability to compute the zero contours of a function of two variables. For example, here we compute a representation of Trott's curve, an example from algebraic geometry [Trott 1997].

<pre class="mcode-input">x = chebfun2(@(x,y) x); y = chebfun2(@(x,y) y);
trott = 144*(x.^4+y.^4)-225*(x.^2+y.^2) + 350*x.^2.*y.^2+81;
r = roots(trott);
LW = 'linewidth'; MS = 'markersize';
plot(r,LW,1.6), axis([-1 1 -1 1]), axis square</pre><img src="img/guide14_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

The zero curves are represented as complex-valued chebfuns (see Section 13.4).   For example,

<pre class="mcode-input">r(:,1)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   chebfun column (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length   endpoint values  
[      -1,       1]      576    complex values 
Epslevel = 1.000000e-05.  Vscale = 9.980190e-01.
</pre>The zero contours of a function are computed by Chebfun2 to plotting accuracy: they are typically not accurate to machine precision.



## 14.2 `roots`

Chebfun2 also comes with the capability of finding zeros of bivariate systems, i.e., the solutions to $f(x,y) = g(x,y) = 0$. If the `roots` command is supplied with one chebfun2, it computes the zero contours of that function, as in the last section.  However, if it is supplied with two chebfun2 objects, as in `roots(f,g)`, then it computes the roots of the bivariate system. Generically, these are isolated points.

What points on Trott's curve intersect the circle of radius $0.9$?

<pre class="mcode-input">g = chebfun2(@(x,y) x.^2 + y.^2 - .9^2);
r = roots(trott,g);
plot(roots(trott),'b',LW,1.6), hold on
plot(roots(g),'r',LW,1.6)
plot(r(:,1),r(:,2),'.k',LW,1.6,MS,20)
axis([-1 1 -1 1]), axis square, hold off</pre><img src="img/guide14_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

The solutions to bivariate polynomial systems and intersections of curves are typically computed to full machine precision.



## 14.3 Intersections of curves

The problem of determining the intersections of real parameterised complex curves can be expressed as a bivariate rootfinding problem.  For instance, here are the intersections between the 'splat' curve [Guettel 2010] and a 'figure-of-eight' curve.

<pre class="mcode-input">t = chebfun('t',[0,2*pi]);
sp = exp(1i*t) + (1+1i)*sin(6*t).^2;     % splat curve
figof8 = cos(t) + 1i*sin(2*t);           % figure of eight curve
plot(sp,LW,1.6), hold on
plot(figof8,'r',LW,1.6), axis equal

d = [0 2*pi 0 2*pi];
f = chebfun2(@(s,t) sp(t)-figof8(s),d);  % rootfinding
r = roots(real(f),imag(f));              % calculate intersections
spr = sp(r(:,2));
plot(real(spr),imag(spr),'.k',MS,20), ylim([-1.1 2.1])
hold off</pre><img src="img/guide14_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

Chebfun2 rootfinding is based on an algorithm described in [Nakatsukasa, Noferini &amp; Townsend 2014].



## 14.4 Global optimisation: `max2`, `min2`, and `minandmax2`

Chebfun2 also provides functionality for global optimisation. Here is an example, where we plot the minimum and maximum as black dots.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(x,y) sin(30*x.*y) + sin(10*y.*x.^2) + exp(-x.^2-(y-.8).^2));
[mn mnloc] = min2(f);
[mx mxloc] = max2(f);
plot(f), hold on
plot3(mnloc(1),mnloc(2),mn,'.r',MS,40)
plot3(mxloc(1),mxloc(2),mx,'.r',MS,30)
zlim([-6 6]), colormap('bone'), hold off</pre><img src="img/guide14_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

If both the global maximum and minimum are required, it is roughly twice as fast to compute them at the same time by using the `minandmax2` command. For instance,

<pre class="mcode-input">tic; [mn mnloc] = min2(f);  [mx mxloc] = max2(f); t=toc;
fprintf('min2 and max2 separately = %5.3fs\n',t)
tic; [Y X] = minandmax2(f); t=toc;
fprintf('minandmax2 command = %5.3fs\n',t)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">min2 and max2 separately = 0.449s
minandmax2 command = 0.191s
</pre>Here is a complicated function from the 2002 SIAM 100-Dollar, 100-Digit Challenge.  Chebfun2 computes its global minimum in a few seconds:

<pre class="mcode-input">tic
f = cheb.gallery2('challenge');
[minval,minpos] = min2(f);
minval
toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">minval =
  -3.306868647474791
Elapsed time is 1.055931 seconds.
</pre>The result closely matches the correct solution, computed to 10,000 digits Bornemann et al. [2004]:

<pre class="mcode-input">exact = -3.306868647475237280076113</pre><pre class="mcode-output">exact =
  -3.306868647475237
</pre>Here is a contour plot of this wiggly function, with the minimum circled in black:

<pre class="mcode-input">colormap('default'), contour(f), hold on
plot(minpos(1),minpos(2),'ok',MS,20,LW,3), hold off</pre><img src="img/guide14_05.png" class="figure" alt="">



## 14.5 Critical points

The critical points of a smooth function of two variables can be located by finding the zeros of $\partial f/ \partial y = \partial f / \partial x = 0$. This is a rootfinding problem.  For example,

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(x,y) (x.^2-y.^3+1/8).*sin(10*x.*y));
r = roots(gradient(f));                       % critical points
plot(roots(diff(f,1,2)),'b',LW,1.2), hold on  % zero contours of f_x
plot(roots(diff(f)),'r',LW,1.2)               % zero contours of f_y
plot(r(:,1),r(:,2),'k.',MS,24)                % extrema
axis([-1,1,-1,1]), axis square</pre><img src="img/guide14_06.png" class="figure" alt="">

There is a new command here called `gradient` that computes the gradient vector and represents it as a chebfun2v object. The `roots` command then solves for the isolated roots of the bivariate polynomial system represented in the chebfun2v representing the gradient. For more information about `gradient`, see Chapter 15.



## 14.6 Infinity norm

The $\infty$-norm of a function is the maximum absolute value in its domain. It can be computed by passing the argument `inf` to the `norm` command.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(x,y) sin(30*x.*y));
norm(f,inf)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.999999999999995
</pre>
