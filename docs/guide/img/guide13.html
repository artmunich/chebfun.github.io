## 13.1 `sum` and `sum2`

We have already seen the `sum2` command, which returns the definite double integral of a chebfun2 over its domain of definition. The `sum` command is a little different, integrating with respect to one variable at a time following the MATLAB analogy. For instance, the following commands integrate $\sin(10xy)$ with respect to $y$:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(x,y) sin(10*x.*y),[0 pi/4 0 3]);
sum(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   chebfun row (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length   endpoint values  
[       0,    0.79]       35  -2.2e-15     0.13 
Epslevel = 3.552714e-15.  Vscale = 2.173762e+00.
</pre>A chebfun is returned because the result depends on $x$ and hence is a function of one variable.  Similarly, we can integrate over the $x$ variable and plot the result.

<pre class="mcode-input">LW = 'linewidth';
sum(f,2), plot(sum(f,2),LW,1.6)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   chebfun column (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length   endpoint values  
[       0,       3]       35  -5.6e-16    0.033 
Epslevel = 3.552714e-15.  Vscale = 5.690896e-01.
</pre><img src="img/guide13_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

A closer look reveals that `sum(f)` returns a row chebfun while `sum(f,2)` returns a column chebfun. This distinction is a reminder that `sum(f)` is a function of $x$ while `sum(f,2)` is a function of $y$. If we integrate over $y$ and then $x$, the result is the double integral of $f$.

<pre class="mcode-input">sum2(f)
sum(sum(f))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.377914013520379
ans =
   0.377914013520379
</pre>It is interesting to compare the execution times involved for computing the double integral by different commands.  Chebfun2 does very well for smooth functions. Here we see an example in which it is faster than the MATLAB `quad2d` command.

<pre class="mcode-input">F = @(x,y) exp(-(x.^2 + y.^2 + cos(4*x.*y)));
tol = 3e-14;
tic, I = quad2d(F,-1,1,-1,1,'AbsTol',tol); t = toc;
fprintf('QUAD2D:  I = %17.15f  time = %6.4f secs\n',I,t)
tic, I = sum(sum(chebfun2(F))); t = toc;
fprintf('CHEBFUN2/SUMSUM:  I = %17.15f  time = %6.4f secs\n',I,t)
tic, I = sum2(chebfun2(F)); t = toc;
fprintf('CHEBFUN2/SUM2:  I = %17.15f  time = %6.4f secs\n',I,t)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">QUAD2D:  I = 1.399888131932670  time = 0.2660 secs
CHEBFUN2/SUMSUM:  I = 1.399888131932670  time = 0.0837 secs
CHEBFUN2/SUM2:  I = 1.399888131932670  time = 0.0351 secs
</pre>Chebfun2 is not designed specifically for numerical quadrature (or more properly, "cubature"), and careful comparisons with existing software have not been carried out. Low rank function approximations have been previously used for numerical quadrature by Carvajal, Chapman, and Geddes [Carvajal, Chapman &amp; Geddes 2005].  A cubature package CHEBINT based on Chebyshev approximations has been produced by Poppe and Cools [Poppe &amp; Cools 2011].



## 13.2 `norm`, `mean`, and `mean2`

The $L^2$-norm of a function $f(x,y)$ can be computed as the square root of the double integral of $f^2$. In Chebfun2 the command `norm(f)`, without any additional arguments, computes this quantity. For example,

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2('exp(-(x.^2 + y.^2 +4*x.*y))');
norm(f), sqrt(sum2(f.^2))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   2.819481057146932
ans =
   2.819481057146935
</pre>Here is another example. This time we compute the norms of $f(x,y)$, $\cos(f(x,y))$, and $f(x,y)^5$.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(x,y) exp(-1./( sin(x.*y) + x ).^2));
norm(f), norm( cos(f) ), norm( f.^5 )</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.462652919760561
ans =
   1.950850368197070
ans =
   0.060896016071932
</pre>The command `mean2` scales the result of `sum2` to return the mean value of $f$ over the rectangle of definition:

<pre class="mcode-input">help chebfun2/mean2</pre><pre class="mcode-output"> MEAN2   Mean of a CHEBFUN2
    V = MEAN2(F) returns the mean of a CHEBFUN: 
  
                         d  b
                        /  /   
    V = 1/(d-c)/(b-a)   |  |   f(x,y) dx dy 
                        /  /
                       c  a
  
  	where the domain of F is [a,b] x [c,d]. 
 
  See also MEAN, STD2.

</pre>For example, here is the average value of a 2D Runge function.

<pre class="mcode-input">runge = chebfun2( @(x,y) 1./( .01 + x.^2 + y.^2 )) ;
plot(runge)
mean2(runge)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   3.796119578934829
</pre><img src="img/guide13_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

The command `mean` computes the average along one variable.  The output is a function of one variable represented by a chebfun, so we can plot it.

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(mean(runge),LW,1.6)
title('Mean value of 2D Runge function wrt y')</pre><img src="img/guide13_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

If we average over $y$ and then $x$, we obtain the mean value over the whole domain, matching the earlier result.

<pre class="mcode-input">mean(mean(runge))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   3.796119578934826
</pre>

## 13.3 `cumsum` and `cumsum2`

The command `cumsum2` computes the double indefinite integral, which is a function of two variables, and returns a chebfun2.

<pre class="mcode-input">help chebfun2/cumsum2</pre><pre class="mcode-output"> CUMSUM2   Double indefinite integral of a CHEBFUN2.
    F = CUMSUM2(F) returns the double indefinite integral of a CHEBFUN2. That is
                    y  x
                   /  /
    CUMSUM2(F) =  |  |   f(x,y) dx dy   for  (x,y) in [a,b] x [c,d],
                  /  /
                 c  a
 
    where [a,b] x [c,d] is the domain of f.
  
  See also CUMSUM, SUM, SUM2.

</pre>On the other hand, `cumsum(f)` computes the indefinite integral with respect to just one variable, also returning a chebfun2. The indefinite integral with respect to $y$ and then $x$ is the same as the double indefinite integral, as we can check numerically.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(x,y) sin(3*((x+1).^2+(y+1).^2)));
contour(cumsum2(f),'numpts',400), axis equal
title('Contours of cumsum2(f)'), axis([-1 1 -1 1])
norm( cumsum(cumsum(f),2) - cumsum2(f) )</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
     0
</pre><img src="img/guide13_04.png" class="figure" alt="">



## 13.4 Complex encoding

As is well known, a pair of real scalar functions $f$ and $g$ can be encoded as a complex function $f+ig$. This trick can be useful for simplifying many operations, though at the same time it may be confusing. For instance, instead of representing the unit circle by two real-valued functions, we can represent it by one complex-valued function:

<pre class="mcode-input">d = [0 2*pi];
c1 = chebfun(@(t) cos(t),d);           % first real-valued function
c2 = chebfun(@(t) sin(t),d);           % second real-valued function
c = chebfun(@(t) cos(t)+1i*sin(t),d);  % one complex function</pre>Here are two ways to make a plot of a circle.

<pre class="mcode-input">subplot(1,2,1), plot(c1,c2,LW,1.6)
axis equal, title('Two real-valued functions')
subplot(1,2,2), plot(c,LW,1.6)
axis equal, title('One complex-valued function')</pre><img src="img/guide13_05.png" class="figure" alt="">

This complex encoding trick is exploited in a number of places in Chebfun2. Specifically, it's used to encode the path of integration for a line integral (see next section), to represent zero contours of a chebfun2 (Chapter 14), and to represent trajectories in vector fields (Chapter 15).

We hope users become comfortable with complex encodings, though they are not required for the majority of Chebfun2 functionality.



## 13.5 Integration along curves

Chebfun2 can compute the integral of $f(x,y)$ along a curve $(x(t),y(t))$. It uses the complex encoding trick and encode the curve $(x(t),y(t))$ as a complex valued chebfun $x(t) + iy(t)$.

For example, here is the curve in the unit square defined by $\exp(10 it)$, $t\in[0,1]$.

<pre class="mcode-input">clf
C = chebfun(@(t) t.*exp(10i*t),[0 1]);
plot(C,'k',LW,2), axis([-1 1 -1 1]), axis square</pre><img src="img/guide13_06.png" class="figure" alt="">

Here is a plot of the function $f(x,y) = \cos(10xy^2) + \exp(-x^2)$ on the square, with the values of $f(x,y)$ on the curve $C$ shown in black:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(x,y) cos(10*x.*y.^2) + exp(-x.^2));
plot(f), hold on
plot3(real(C),imag(C),f(C),'k',LW,2)</pre><img src="img/guide13_07.png" class="figure" alt="">

The object $|f(C)|$ is just a real-valued function defined on $[0,1]$, whose integral we can readily compute:

<pre class="mcode-input">sum(f(C))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   1.613596461872283
</pre>This number can be interpreted as the integral of $f(x,y)$ along the curve $C$.



## 13.6 `diff`, `diffx`, `diffy`

In MATLAB the `diff` command calculates finite differences of a matrix along its columns (by default) or rows. For a chebfun2 the same syntax represents partial differentiation $\partial f/\partial y$ (by default) or $\partial f/\partial x$.

As pointed out in the last chapter, however, this can be rather confusing.  Accordingly Chebfun2 offers the alternatives `diffx` and `diffy` with more obvious meaning.  Here for example is the syntax of `diffx`:

<pre class="mcode-input">help chebfun2/diffx</pre><pre class="mcode-output"> DIFFX   Differentiate a CHEBFUN2 with respect to its first argument.
 
    G = DIFFX(F) returns a CHEBFUN2 representing the derivative of F in its
    first argument. This is the same as DIFF(F,1,2).
 
    G = DIFFX(F,N) returns a CHEBFUN2 representing the Nth derivative of F in
    its first argument. This is the same as DIFF(F,N,2).
 
    This command is for convenience as the syntax for DIFF, inherited from the
    DIFF command for matrices, can be confusing.
  
  See also DIFFY, DIFF. 

</pre>Here we use `diffx` and `diffy` to check that the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold for an analytic function.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(x,y) sin(x+1i*y));   % a holomorphic function
u = real(f); v = imag(f);           % real and imaginary parts
norm(diffy(v) - diffx(u))
norm(diffx(v) + diffy(u))         % Do the Cauchy-Riemann eqns hold?</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
     2.577622443765214e-14
ans =
     1.064740840017172e-14
</pre>

## 13.7 Integration in three variables

Chebfun2 also works pretty well for integration in three variables. The idea is to integrate over two of the variables using Chebfun2 and the remaining variable using Chebfun. We have selected a tolerance of $10^{-6}$ for this example because the default tolerance in the MATLAB `integral3` command is also $10^{-6}$.

<pre class="mcode-input">r = @(x,y,z) sqrt(x.^2 + y.^2 + z.^2);
t = @(x,y,z) acos(z./r(x,y,z)); p = @(x,y,z) atan(y./x);
f = @(x,y,z) sin(5*(t(x,y,z) - r(x,y,z))) .* sin(p(x,y,z)).^2;

I = @(z) sum2(chebfun2(@(x,y) f(x,y,z),[-2 2 .5 2.5]));
tic, I = sum(chebfun(@(z) I(z),[1 2],'vectorize')); t = toc;
fprintf('          Chebfun2:  I = %16.14f  time = %5.3f secs\n',I,t)
tic, I = integral3(f,-2,2,.5,2.5,1,2); t = toc;
fprintf('  MATLAB integral3:  I = %16.14f  time = %5.3f secs\n',I,t)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">          Chebfun2:  I = -0.48056569408898  time = 2.685 secs
  MATLAB integral3:  I = -0.48056569417568  time = 1.289 secs
