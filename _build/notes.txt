CURRENT:
Chebfun is a collection of algorithms and an open-source
software system in object-oriented MATLAB which extends
familiar powerful methods of numerical computation involving
numbers to continuous or piecewise-continuous functions. It
also implements continuous analogues of linear algebra notions
like the QR decomposition and the SVD, and solves ordinary
differential equations. The mathematical basis of the system
combines tools of Chebyshev expansions, fast Fourier transform,
barycentric interpolation, recursive zerofinding, and automatic
differentiation. For the mathematical foundations of Chebfun,
see Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice.

REVISED?
Chebfun is an open-source MATLAB package for computing with
functions to 15-digit accuracy.  Most Chebfun commands are
overloads of familiar MATLAB commands -- for example SUM(f)
computes an integral, ROOTS(f) finds zeros, and u = L\f solves
a differential equation.  Click <here> for more.

<more>The mathematical basis of Chebfun is piecewise
polynomial interpolation implemented with what we call "Chebyshev
technology".  The foundations are described, with Chebfun examples,
in <>Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice<>.
Chebfun has extensive capabilities for dealing with linear and
nonlinear differential and integral operators, and it also
includes continuous analogues of linear algebra notions like QR
and singular value decomposition.  The Chebfun2 extension works
with functions of two variables defined on a rectangle in the
x-y plane.  To get a sense of the breadth and power of Chebfun,
a great place to start is by looking at our <Examples>.
