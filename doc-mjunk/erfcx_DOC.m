%% ERFCX :: Scaled complementary error function of a CHEBFUN.
%    ERFCX(X) is the scaled complementary error function of the real-valued
%    CHEBFUN X. The scaled complementary error function is defined as:
%        ERFCX(X) = EXP(X.^2) * ERFC(X)
%    which is approximately (1/sqrt(pi)) * 1./X for large X.
