%% DETECTEDGE :: Edge detection.
%    EDGE = DETECTEDGE(F, DOMAIN, HSCALE, VSCALE) detects a blowup in the first,
%    second, third, or fourth derivatives of F in [A,B]. HSCALE is the horizontal
%    scale and VSCALE is the vertical scale (note that both are required). If no
%    edge is detected, EDGE is set to the midpoint of DOMAIN.
