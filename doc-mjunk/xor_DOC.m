%% XOR :: Logical CHEBFUN EXCLUSIVE OR.
%      XOR(S,T) is the logical symmetric difference of CHEBFUNs S and T.
%      The result is logical 1 (TRUE) where either S or T, but not both, is
%      nonzero.  The result is logical 0 (FALSE) where S and T are both zero
%      or nonzero.  S and T must have the same dimensions (or one can be a
%      scalar).
