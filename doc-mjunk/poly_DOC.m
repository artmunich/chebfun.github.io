%% POLY	 Polynomial coefficients of a CHEBFUN.
%    POLY(F) returns the polynomial coefficients of the first FUN of F.
% 
%    POLY(F, N) returns the polynomial coefficients of the Nth FUN of F. 
% 
%    For numerical work, the Chebyshev polynomial coefficients returned by
%    CHEBPOLY() are more useful.
