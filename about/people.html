    <h3>Anthony Austin</h3>
    Anthony Austin started as a DPhil student at Oxford in 2012. When not
    doing research related to contour integrals, large-scale linear algebra,
    and rational approximation, he is our code guru, keeping us honest with
    object-oriented programming and Git. After Nick Hale, he is the team
    member responsible for the most lines of Chebfun v5.

    <h3>Zachary Battles</h3>
    Zachary Battles was a Rhodes Scholar and DPhil student from 2002 to 2005,
    and he wrote Chebfun version 1.  It has hard to believe it was just a few
    hundred lines of code!  Zachary introduced the recursive rootfinding
    algorithm in ROOTS as well as commands such as QR, SVD, \, RANK and COND
    for quasimatrices.

    Asgeir Birkisson was an MSc and then DPhil student at Oxford from 2008 to
    2014.  With Toby Driscoll he introduced automatic differentiation into
    Chebfun and thus enabled us to solve nonlinear differential equations.  He
    also wrote CHEBGUI.

    responsible for SOLVEBVP, EIGS, EXPM, VOLT, and FRED.  He has also led
    Chebfun's movement to more advanced linear and nonlinear block structures.

    (with Driscoll and Birkisson, including PDE15S) and fast quadrature and
    orthogonal expansions (with Townsend, including SUM, LEGPTS, CHEB2LEG, and
    CONV).  He was director of the Chebfun project from 2010 to 2014 and
