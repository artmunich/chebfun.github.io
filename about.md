About
======

Chebfun is a collection of algorithms and an open-source software system in object-oriented MATLAB which extends familiar powerful methods of numerical computation involving numbers to continuous or piecewise-continuous functions. It also implements continuous analogues of linear algebra notions like the QR decomposition and the SVD, and solves ordinary differential equations. The mathematical basis of the system combines tools of Chebyshev expansions, fast Fourier transform, barycentric interpolation, recursive zerofinding, and automatic differentiation. For the mathematical foundations of Chebfun, see Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice.
