<pre class="mcode-input">LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 1.5;</pre>In this example, we compute a few integrals over closed contours in the complex plane using periodic chebfuns.

Consider a smooth and closed contour $\Gamma$ in the complex plane and let us say we want to compute $$ \int_{\Gamma} f(z) dz. $$ If we parametrize $\Gamma$ using a real varaible, say $t$ , then since the contour is closed, the intgrand becomes periodic in $t$ and we get $$ \int_{\Gamma} f(z) dz = \int_{a}^{b} f(z(t)) z'(t) dt. $$

All this can be done very efficiently in Chebfun. Thanks to the underlying Fourier-technology which has been integrated with Chebfun's usual Chebyshev technology.

Here is a simple example. Consider the function:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = @(z) (1-2*z)./(z.*(z-1).*(z-3));</pre>Say we want to integrate this funciton on a circle of radius $2$. To do this in Chebfun's periodic mode, we first parametrize the circle:

<pre class="mcode-input">z = chebfun(@(t) 2*exp(2*pi*1i*t), [0, 1], 'periodic');
plot(z, LW, lw)
ylim( [-2.5, 2.5] ), axis equal

The integrand is then constructed by a simple composition:

<pre class="mcode-input">I = f(z)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I =
   chebfun column (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length   endpoint values periodic
[       0,       1]      145    complex values 
Epslevel = 6.780169e-14.  Vscale = 1.500000e+00.
</pre>This is how the real and imaginary part of the integrand looks on the contour:

<pre class="mcode-input">subplot(1, 2, 1)
plot(real(I), LW, lw)
title('real part of the function')
subplot(1, 2, 2)
plot(imag(I), LW, lw)
title('Imaginary part of the function')</pre><img src="img/ClosedContours_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

To compute the integral, we recall that $$ \int_{|z|=2} f(z) dz = \int_{0}^{1} f(z(t)) z'(t) dt. $$ We theefore, first compute $z'(t)$:

<pre class="mcode-input">dz = diff(z);</pre>Computing the integral now can not be easier:

<pre class="mcode-input">s = sum(I.*dz)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">s =
 -0.000000000000001 + 5.235987755982991i
</pre>The true answer is $5 \pi i/3$, and we see that Chebfun has done a very good job:

<pre class="mcode-input">norm(s - 5/3*pi*1i)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
     2.739369827896639e-15
</pre>Here is another example. Consider the well known function

<pre class="mcode-input">f = @(z) sin(z)./z;</pre>This analytic function has a remobable singularity at the origin. Therefore, the integral of the function on any closed contour should be zero according to Cauchy's theorem.

<pre class="mcode-input">z = chebfun(@(t) exp(2*pi*1i*t), [0, 1], 'periodic');
I = f(z);
dz = diff(z);</pre>Again, we plot the real and imaginary part of the integrand on the unit circle:

<pre class="mcode-input">subplot(1, 2, 1)
plot(real(I), LW, lw)
title('real part of the function')
subplot(1, 2, 2)
plot(imag(I), LW, lw)
title('Imaginary part of the function')</pre><img src="img/ClosedContours_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

And here is the integral, which is numerically zero:

<pre class="mcode-input">s = sum(I.*dz)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">s =
      3.838199599418398e-16 - 7.739840514529662e-15i
</pre>As our final example, we pick a function with an essential singularity at the origin and compute its integral on the unit circle.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = @(z) exp(1./z).*sin(1./z);
z = chebfun(@(t) exp(2*pi*1i*t), [0, 1], 'periodic');
I = f(z);
dz = diff(z);
s = sum(I.*dz)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">s =
 -0.000000000000001 + 6.283185307179584i
</pre>
