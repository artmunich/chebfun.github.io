A rose curve is a sinusoid in polar coordinates, that is, $$ r = \sin(k\theta). $$ Rational values of $k$ produce closed curves, while irrational values produce curves of infinite length that fill the unit disc. If $k = 1$, then the result is a circle.

The Wikipedia page about rose curves [1] contains a nice image of many roses for different rational values of $k$. This Example reproduces that image.

In order to plot the roses, we will paramatrize them in the complex plane using Cartesian coordinates: $$ x(t) = \cos(k t) \sin(t), $$ $$ y(t) = i \cos(k t) \cos(t). $$ Here is a function that creates a chebfun of a rose based on the parameter $k = m/n$ for two integers $m$ and $n$. The domain must be at least as long as $2\pi$ times the least common multiple of $m$ and $n$.

<pre class="mcode-input">roseCurve = @(m,n) chebfun(@(t) cos(m/n*t).*cos(t)+1i*cos(m/n*t).*sin(t), ...
                           [0, 2*pi*lcm(m,n)]);</pre>Here is the image reproduced.

<pre class="mcode-input">LW = 'linewidth';
figure('position', [0 0 680 680]), hold on
N = 6;
for m = 1:N
    for n = 1:N
        f = roseCurve(m,n);
        offset = 2.5*m - 2.5i*n;
        plot(f + offset, 'k-', LW, 1)
    end
end
axis equal tight off</pre><img src="img/RoseCurves_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

And here is a more ambitious image of the same kind, where the patterns along diagonals become clear.

<pre class="mcode-input">tic
clf, hold on
N = 12;
for m = 1:N
    for n = 1:N
        f = roseCurve(m,n);
        offset = 2.5*m - 2.5i*n;
        plot(f + offset, 'k-', LW, .8)
    end
end
axis equal tight off
time = toc;</pre><img src="img/RoseCurves_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

The above image did not take long to produce:

<pre class="mcode-input">time</pre><pre class="mcode-output">time =
   5.865927139000000
</pre>
