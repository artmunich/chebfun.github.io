## Introduction

Suppose $A$ is a given $m \times n$ matrix. The problem of finding the orthonormal matrix $Q$ nearest to $A$ is well-known [4] (by an orthonormal matrix, we mean a matrix with orthonormal columns). Specifically, it is the following problem:    $$ \mbox{argmin}\_U ||A-U||_\mbox{fro} \quad\mbox{subject to}\quad U^T U = I. $$ This problem is a special case of the orthogonal Procrustes problem [3, p. 327]. There are different ways to find the unique solution to this problem. One way that expresses $Q$ explicitly requires finding a matrix inverse square root [5] as follows:

$$ Q = A(A^T A)^{-1/2}. $$

However, the simplest (and possibly a numerically more stable) way is to compute the singular value decomposition of $A$ and to replace the singular values by ones. In other words, if $A = U S V^T$, then $Q = U V^T$ is the nearest orthonormal matrix to $A$. This is actually the unitary factor in the polar decomposition of $A$ [4].

Our goal is to generalize this situation to the continuous case. Suppose that a set of functions defined on a domain are given. We know how to use Chebfun's `qr` command to compute orthogonal functions (stored as the columns of a qusimatrix `Q2`) corresponding to our given functions. See e.g. [2, Ch. 6] for details. Here, we are looking for the nearest set of orthonormal functions. In Chebfun this is also straightforward. We just need to create a quasimatrix out of our given set of functions and use Chebfun's overloaded `svd` command [1]. The function `[Q,Q2] = nearestOrtho(A)` in the following computes both `Q` and `Q2`.



## The first six monomials

<pre class="mcode-input">A = cheb.gallery('vandermonde'); % A = [1, x, x.^2, x.^3, x.^4, x.^5];
[Q,Q2] = nearestOrtho(A);</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Departure from orthogonality in the columns of A = 1.35
Departure from orthogonality in the columns of Q = 2.1e-15
Departure from orthogonality in the columns of Q2 = 1.7e-15
The distance between A and Q2 = 1.92
The distance between A and its closest orthonormal quasimatrix = 1.69

Here, we see Legendre polynomials scaled to have norm 1 (left) and the nearest set of orthonormal functions (right). The first polynomial among these nearest orthonormal polynomials is approximately the following: $ p(x) = 0.9200 - 0.9035 x^2 + 0.3084 x^4$.
