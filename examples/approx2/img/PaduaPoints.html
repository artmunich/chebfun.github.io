Padua points (named after the University of Padua, where they were discovered in 2005 [1]) are the first known example of a unisolvent point set over bivariate polynomials which have a provably minimal growth in Lebesgue constant of $O(\log^2 n)$. They are sometimes refered to as the "Chebyshev points in 2D" [1].

It seemed only natural to include these points in Chebfun, and they are now available through the `paduapts` method. For example, here is the Padua grid corresponding to $n = 8$:

<pre class="mcode-input">n = 8;
x = paduapts( n );
plot(x(:,1), x(:,2), 'ok', 'MarkerFaceColor', 'k')
axis equal, axis([-1 1 -1 1]), hold on
FS = 'FontSize';

There are a number of characterizations of Padua points. One is as the intersection of a certain Lissajous curve [2] with itself and the boundary of $[-1,1]\times[-1,1]$:

<pre class="mcode-input">t = chebfun('t', [0 pi]);
L = -cos((n + 1)*t) - 1i*cos(n*t);        % Lissajous curve
plot(L, 'b')</pre><img src="img/PaduaPoints_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

Another is as every other point from an $(n+1)\times(n+2)$ tensor product Chebyshev grid:

<pre class="mcode-input">x1 = chebpts(n + 1);
x2 = chebpts(n + 2);
[X, Y] = meshgrid(x1, x2);
plot(X, Y, 'or'), hold off</pre><img src="img/PaduaPoints_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

If a matrix rather than a bivariate function is supplied as an input, Chebfun2 normally assumes that its values correspond to data on a Chebyshev tensor product grid. However, if the `'padua'` flag is supplied, the constructor assumes the values are data on a Padua grid and returns a bivariate polynomial that interpolates the prescribed data. For example:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = @(x,y) cos(exp(2*x+y)).*sin(y);
fx = f(x(:,1), x(:,2));                   % Samples from Padua grid
F = chebfun2(fx, [-1 1 -1 1], 'padua');   % Construct Chebfun2 from samples
plot(F), hold on
plot3(x(:,1), x(:,2), F(x(:,1), x(:,2)), 'ok', 'MarkerFaceColor', 'k'), hold off</pre><img src="img/PaduaPoints_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

The corresponding Padua interpolant is a bivariate Chebyshev polynomial of total degree $n$ (i.e. the degrees in $x$ and $y$ sum to at most $n$). We can verify this by looking at the coefficients of the interpolant:

<pre class="mcode-input">C = chebcoeffs2(F);
C(abs(C) &lt; 1e-10) = 0;
spy(rot90(C, 2)), shg
title('Spy plot of bivariate Chebyshev coefficients',FS,14)</pre><img src="img/PaduaPoints_05.png" class="figure" alt="">

We hope this addition will make it easy to explore Padua interpolants in Chebfun2!
