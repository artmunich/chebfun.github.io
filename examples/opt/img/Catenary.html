<pre class="mcode-input">FS = 'fontsize'; LW = 'linewidth';</pre>Suppose we wish to solve a classical problem from the calculus of variations of the form

$$ \min_{y(t)} J[y] \equiv \int_{-1}^1 f(t,y,y') dt $$

subject to the boundary conditions

$$ y(-1) = \alpha, \quad y(1) = \beta. $$

Problems like this arise in physics, for example, when $J$ is an energy functional.

A standard example of a variational problem is the catenary problem, which is to determine the shape of a hanging rope. In this case $J$ is an energy functional taking the form [1]

$$ J[y] = \int f(t,y,y') dt = \int y \sqrt{1 + (y')^2} dt. $$

To solve this problem with Chebfun, we begin with the functional and boundary conditions. We will choose boundary conditions that make it easy to verify the known solution.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = @(y,yp) y .* sqrt(1 + yp.^2);
J = @(y) sum( f(y, diff(y)) );

alpha = cosh(1);
beta  = cosh(1);</pre>Since the problem is nonlinear, we will need to solve it iteratively. As an initial guess to the iteration we'll choose a simple line, and note its functional value.

<pre class="mcode-input">dom = [-1,1];
y0 = chebfun([alpha, beta]', dom);
startJ = J(y0)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">startJ =
   3.086161269630488
</pre>The simplest way to compute extrema of the functional $J[y]$ is to find solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equation

$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} -
\frac{d}{dx}\frac{\partial f}{\partial (u')} = 0. $$

To do so we must compute the first variations of the function $f$,

$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial u}, \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial u'}. $$

Using only information about first variations, we could implement a steepest descent method. However, if can also get our hands on the second variations of $f$, then we could implement a more efficient Newton method. The second- variation equivalent of the Euler-Lagrange equation, sometimes called Jacobi's accessory equation, is

$$ \frac{d}{dx}\Big(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial(u')^2}\Big) +
\Big(\frac{d}{dx}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial u \partial u'}-
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial u^2}\Big)u = 0. $$

To find the first and second variations, we will use Chebfun2. First we make a chebfun2 of $f$.

<pre class="mcode-input">dom2 = [1 2 -2 4];
F = chebfun2(f, dom2);</pre>Now we can compute the first and second variations of $f(y,y')$ by taking derivatives of `F`: each `diff(F,[a b])` is a chebfun2 corresponding to

$$ \frac{\partial^{(a+b)} f}{\partial^a (u) \partial^b (u')}. $$

<pre class="mcode-input">F1  = diff(F, [1 0]);
F2  = diff(F, [0 1]);
F11 = diff(F, [2 0]);
F12 = diff(F, [1 1]);
F22 = diff(F, [0 2]);</pre>Now we are able to compute, say $\partial f(y,y')/\partial u$ for a particular function $y$ by writing `F1(y,diff(y))` for a chebfun `y`.

The iteration will take Newton steps by solving the accessory equation. Five iterations are enough to get an accurate solution.

<pre class="mcode-input">y = y0;
pref = cheboppref;
pref.plotting = 'off';
pref.display = 'none';

for k = 1:5
    % The first and second variations of f.
    yp = diff(y);
    f1  = F1(y, yp);
    f2  = F2(y, yp);
    f11 = F11(y, yp);
    f12 = F12(y, yp);
    f22 = F22(y, yp);

    % Compute the next Newton step by solving the accessory equation.
    N = chebop( @(x,u) diff(f22.*diff(u)) + (diff(f12)-f11).*u, dom );
    N.lbc = 0;
    N.rbc = 0;
    u = solvebvp(N, (f1-diff(f2)), pref);

    % Increment by the step.
    y = y + u;

    % Print out the current value of the energy functional.
    nextJ = J(y)
