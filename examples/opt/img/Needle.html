<pre class="mcode-input">function needle()</pre>The final problem for Oxford's Numerical Analysis Problem Solving Squad this year was the following:

A needle of length $1$ rests on a surface defined by the height function

$$ h(x) = 0.1 x^2 + 0.1\sin(6x) + 0.03\sin(12x). $$

What is the lowest possible height of the centre of the needle?

Let's begin with a picture:

<pre class="mcode-input">LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize'; MS = 'markersize';
s = chebfun('s',[-4 4]);
h = .1*s.^2 + .1*sin(6*s)+.03*sin(12*s);
close all, plot(h,LW,1), axis equal, axis([-4 4 -.4 2])</pre><img src="img/Needle_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

We see immediately that the optimal position of the center of the needle, call it $x$, will lie in $[-2,2]$.  Actually it's pretty clear it will lie in $[-1,1]$.

This is obviously an optimization problem, but exactly how should we formulate it?  One interpretation is that it is a problem of _semiinfinite programming_, because it mixes an objective function to minimize with a continuum of constraints.  Presumably there are methods that could be used to solve it in this framework.

For us, when I hear the word "continuum", we think Chebfun. Suppose we specify two variables: $x$, the horizontal position of the center of the needle, and $\theta$, its angle counterclockwise from the horizontal.  Given $x$ and $\theta$, we then ask how low the needle can lie.  Let

$$ y(x,\theta) $$

be its minimal height, given that it does not cut below the surface. Then $y(x,\theta)$ is just a maximum of a continuous function over an interval, which we can compute with Chebfun like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">function y = minfun(x,theta)
r = .5*cos(theta); hx = h{x-r,x+r};
needle = chebfun(@(s) tan(theta)*(s-x),[x-r x+r]);
y = max(hx-needle);
end</pre>And here is a function for plotting a particular configuration:

<pre class="mcode-input">function plotneedle(x,theta)
y = minfun(x,theta);
r = .5*cos(theta); hx = h{x-r,x+r};
needle = chebfun(@(s) y+tan(theta)*(s-x),[x-r x+r]);
hold off, plot(h,'b',needle,'k',LW,1)
axis equal, axis([-4 4 -.4 2])
end</pre>For example, here are needle positions for $(x,\theta) = (-.6, -0.2)$ and $(x,\theta) = (1.7, 1)$.

<pre class="mcode-input">subplot(2,1,1)
plotneedle(-0.6,-0.2), title('needle with (x,theta) = (-.6, -0.2)',FS,14)
subplot(2,1,2)
plotneedle(1.7,1), title('needle with (x,theta) = (1.7, 1)',FS,14)</pre><img src="img/Needle_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

Now we just have to minimize over $x$ and $\theta$. Let's first do that over a wide range.

<pre class="mcode-input">npts = 25;
tic, x = linspace(-2,2,npts);
theta = linspace(-1.5,1.5,npts);
[xx,thth] = meshgrid(x,theta); yy = 0*xx;
for k = 1:length(x)
  for j = 1:length(theta)
    yy(j,k) = minfun(xx(j,k),thth(j,k));
  end
end
close, contour(x,theta,yy,80), grid on, xlabel('x',FS,14), ylabel('theta',FS,14)
colorbar, title(['min value on grid: ' num2str(min(yy(:)))],FS,14), toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Elapsed time is 23.348271 seconds.
</pre><img src="img/Needle_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

In this picture we see that there are two promising regions: one with $(x,\theta) \approx (-.5, -.4)$, and one with $(x,\theta) \approx (.5, -.2)$. The central white regions have an interesting interpretation: if the needle is balanced on top of a mountain, then moving it left or right, or tilting it, doesn't have much effect.

Zooming in confirms this picture:

<pre class="mcode-input">tic, x = linspace(-0.8,0.6,npts); theta = linspace(-0.5,0,npts);
[xx,thth] = meshgrid(x,theta); yy = 0*xx;
for k = 1:length(x)
  for j = 1:length(theta)
    yy(j,k) = minfun(xx(j,k),thth(j,k));
  end
end
levels = 0.06:.003:0.12;
contour(x,theta,yy,levels), grid on, xlabel('x',FS,14), ylabel('theta',FS,14)

</pre><img src="img/Needle_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

The winner seems to be the region on the right. From here the right thing to do is call a bivariate optimization routine. In basic Matlab the simplest one is the direct search code `<a href="http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/matlab/ref/fminsearch.html">fminsearch</a>`. This requires the input to be a single vector, so we'll need a wrapper:

<pre class="mcode-input">function y = minfunwrapper(xvec)
y = minfun(xvec(1),xvec(2));
end</pre>Here goes.

<pre class="mcode-input">opts = optimset('tolx',1e-14,'display','off');
guess = [.41, -0.2];
tic, [xvec,yval] = fminsearch(@minfunwrapper,guess,opts); toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Elapsed time is 11.171517 seconds.
</pre>So it would seem that to 10 digits or more, the minimal height is around

<pre class="mcode-input">yval</pre><pre class="mcode-output">yval =
   0.076897745875264
