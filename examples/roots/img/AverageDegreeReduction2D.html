## 2D subdivision

Generally, Chebfun2 approximates globally smooth functions $f(x,y)$ by global low rank polynomial interpolants. However, in the bivariate rootfinding algorithm to solve

$$ f(x,y) = g(x,y) = 0, $$

we use piecewise smooth interpolants if the polynomial degrees are larger than $16$ in the $x$- or $y$-variable (of $f$ or $g$). In bivariate rootfinder the resultant based method recursively subdivides the rectangular domain and the functions $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are approximated by piecewise smooth bivariate polynomial interpolants with each piece of degree at most $16$. Subdivision is useful for reducing the complexity of the bivariate rootfinding algorithm. The reduction in the complexity is determined by a parameter $\tau$ that measures the average degree reduction. Essentially subdivision means that much higher degree problems can be solved (see [1,2]).



## The average degree reduction parameter

The parameter $\tau$ measures the average reduction in polynomial degrees of $f(x,y)$. That is, if a polynomial of degree $n$ (in the $x$- and $y$-variable) is required to approximate $f(x,y)$ on $[-1,1]\times[-1,1]$ then the average degree required to approximate $f$ on $[-1,r]\times[-1,s]$ (and the other subdomains) is $\tau n$, where $r$ and $s$ are two small arbitrary constants. Throughout this Example we take symmetric functions, i.e., $f(x,y) = f(y,x)$ since then the degree reduction is identical in the $x$ and $y$ direction, which considerably simplifies the discussion. The average degree reduction parameter was introduced in [1].



## Rank one functions

A function $f(x,y)$ is of rank $1$ if it can can be written as a product of univariate functions, i.e., $f(x,y) = h(x)k(y)$. Since in this example we are considering only symmetric functions we have $f(x,y) = h(x)h(y)$. For rank $1$ functions the average degree reduction parameter is typically about $1/2$ because under subdivision the degree reduction is directly determined by the degree reduction in $h(x)$. The average degree reduction parameter for univariate functions is discussed in [2]. For example,

<pre class="mcode-input">M = 2000;
f = @(x,y) sin(M*x).*sin(M*y);
compute_tau(f, 2)          % Expected to be approximately 1/2</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Tau = 0.33178</pre>The parameter $\tau$ in this case is equal to $1/2$ because the number of oscillations of $f(x,y)$ in a rectangular domain $[a,b]\times[c,d]$ is directly proportional to $(b-a)(d-c)$. Moreover, the number of oscillations determines the number of points required to resolve the function. Therefore, each subdivision (in the $x$ or $y$ direction) halves the numerical degree of the polynomial interpolant and $\tau \approx 1/2$.

Here is a diagram that shows the numerical degrees after each level of subdivision:

<pre class="mcode-input">subdivisionDiagram(f)</pre><img src="img/AverageDegreeReduction2D_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

In general, if $h(x)$ is a univariate function with average degree reduction parameter $\tau$ then the rank $1$ function $f(x,y) = h(x)h(y)$ has the same average degree reduction parameter.



## Toeplitz functions

A function $f(x,y)$ on $[-1,1]\times[-1,1]$ is defined as Toeplitz if there is a univariate function $h(t)$ on $[-2,2]$ such that $f(x,y) = h(x-y)$. Functions in this class are typically of rank at least two and the average degree reduction parameter cannot be understood from the univariate setting.

<pre class="mcode-input">M = 20;
f = @(x,y) sin(M*(x-y));
compute_tau(f, 2)          % Expected to be approximately 1/sqrt(2) = 0.707</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Tau = 1.30609</pre>The average $\tau$ parameter can be explained since all the oscillations of $f$ occur along diagonals, i.e., $y=-x$ (rather than in the coordinate directions). Two subdivisions, one in the $x$ and one in the $y$ direction are required to halve the length of the diagonal lines and hence, $\tau^2 \approx 1/2$ and $\tau = 1/\sqrt{2}$.

Here is a diagram that shows the numerical degrees after each level of subdivision:

<pre class="mcode-input">clf, subdivisionDiagram(f)</pre><img src="img/AverageDegreeReduction2D_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

It can be seen that the numerical degree reduces by a factor of approximately $1/\sqrt{2}$ on each subdivision:

<pre class="mcode-input">[m,n]=length(chebfun2(f));
max(m,n)./2.^(0:.5:1.5)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
  Columns 1 through 3
  65.000000000000000  45.961940777125584  32.500000000000000
  Column 4
  22.980970388562795
</pre>

## Symmetric Cauchy function

The symmetric Cauchy function is given by $f(x,y) = 1/(x+y)$ defined on $[a,b]\times[a,b]$, where $0&lt;a&lt;b$. This is a 2D generalisation of functions of the form $1/(x+c)$, which has been used to investigate the parameter $\tau$ in the univariate case [2]. The numerical degree of $f(x,y)$ can be determined by using Eliott's method for all $0&lt;a&lt;b$.

However, this is an example where the average degree reduction depends on the subdivision level. Initially subdivision is very helpful, but as more levels are taken subdivision helps less. For example,

<pre class="mcode-input">a = 1; b = 100;
f = @(x,y) 1./((b-a)/2*((x+1)+(y+1))+2*a);  %f = 1/(x+y) on [a,b]x[a,b]
clf, subdivisionDiagram(f)</pre><img src="img/AverageDegreeReduction2D_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

Using Elliott's method we have an exact formula for the numerical degree of $f$, for example, the numerical degree in the bottom-left subdomain should be the following:

<pre class="mcode-input">j=1;
for b = [100 50 25 17.5]
    a = 1; r = b/a;
    B = (r+3)/(r-1);
    m(j) = ceil(log(4/(r-1)*eps^(-1)/sqrt(B^2-1))/log(B+sqrt(B^2-1)));
    j=j+1;
end
m.'</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =

</pre>

## Conclusion

Subdivision is an important technique for rootfinding to reduce the complexity of a rootfinding algorithm. Subdivision is most effective when the average degree reduction parameter is small (such as for rank one functions). Typically, we observe the $\tau$ parameter is approximately $1/\sqrt{2} = 0.707$ for bivariate functions.
