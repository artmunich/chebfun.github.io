## Bivariate rootfinding

Here we explore a new algorithm in Chebfun2 by Nakatsukasa, Noferini, and Townsend for computing the solutions to bivariate rootfinding problems,

$$ f(x,y) = g(x,y) = 0, \quad (x,y)\in [-1,1]\times[-1,1], $$

where $f$ and $g$ are represented by chebfun2 objects. Numerically, this problem can be solved by many different methods such as the homotopy continuation method [3], the two-parameter eigenvalue method [1], the resultant method [2], and Marching Squares [4,5]. More information on existing numerical methods for bivariate rootfinding can be found in [2].

Univariate rootfinding is one of the most important capabilities of 1D Chebfun and one expects that bivariate rootfinding will become equally crucial for Chebfun2. Early versions of Chebfun2 used a contouring algorithm based on Marching Squares [5], which is adequate for many examples, but not completely robust (see below). As of today, the new Chebfun2 employs a resultant method based on Bezout matrices, regularisation, and 2D subdivision [2]. We have found this approach to be numerically robust, and surprisingly efficient for high degree examples. In this Example we will play with the Chebfun2 command `roots`, but for details of the new algorithm we refer the reader to [2].



## Optional arguments and defaults

The new Chebfun2 `roots` command allows for a third argument to supply a user preferred method. The syntax `roots(f,g,'resultant')` and `roots(f,g,'marchingsquares')` employ the new resultant based algorithm and the old Marching Squares approach, respectively. For example

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(x,y) cos(7*x.^2.*y + y));
g = chebfun2(@(x,y) cos(7*x.*y));

r = roots(f,g,'resultant');
% r = roots(f,g,'marchingsquares');   % uncomment to use Marching Squares

plot(roots(f), 'r', LW, lw), hold on
plot(roots(g), 'b', LW, lw)
plot(r(:,1), r(:,2), 'k.', MS, ms)
axis equal, hold off</pre><img src="img/ResultantMethod_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

By default the new Chebfun2 `roots` command employs the resultant method if the degrees of $f$ and $g$ are less than 200 and Marching Squares otherwise. However, we always treat the computed zeros from Marching Squares with suspicion.

Here are a few examples:



## Example 1: Travelling waves

Here we take an example so the zero contours of $f$ and $g$ look like orthogonally travelling waves.

<pre class="mcode-input">w = 10;
f = chebfun2(@(x,y) sin(w*x-y/w) + y);
g = chebfun2(@(x,y) cos(w*y-x/w) - x);
tic, r = roots(f, g, 'resultant'); toc

plot(roots(f), 'r', LW, lw), hold on
plot(roots(g), 'b', LW, lw)
plot(r(:,1), r(:,2), 'k.', MS, ms)
axis([-1,1,-1,1]), axis equal, hold off</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Elapsed time is 4.947122 seconds.
</pre><img src="img/ResultantMethod_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

The new algorithm based on the resultant method does not compute the zero contours of $f$ and $g$, but we display them throughout this Example to visualise the computed solutions.



## Example 2: Coordinate alignment

Traditionally, resultant methods have numerical difficulties when many solutions are aligned along a coordinate direction, and some implementations use a change of variables to prevent any solutions aligning in this way. In [2] a careful case-by-case study is provided to show that these numerical difficulties are not inherent to a resultant method.  For example

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun2(@(x,y) cos(7*acos(x)).*cos(7*acos(y)).*cos(x.*y));
g = chebfun2(@(x,y) cos(10*acos(x)).*cos(10*acos(y)).*cos(x.^2.*y));
tic, r = roots(f, g, 'resultant'); toc

plot(roots(f), 'r', LW, lw), hold on
plot(roots(g), 'b', LW, lw)
plot(r(:,1), r(:,2), 'k.', MS, ms)
axis([-1,1,-1,1]), axis equal, hold off</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Elapsed time is 20.397364 seconds.
</pre><img src="img/ResultantMethod_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

The diagram above shows that we have found all the solutions, and we can get a rough idea of the error in the computed solutions by computing the residual:

<pre class="mcode-input">max( norm(f(r(:,1),r(:,2))), norm(g(r(:,1),r(:,2))))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
     2.401254443675995e-13
</pre>For this example the exact solutions can be derived and the computed solutions checked to be very accurate.



## Example 3: Autonomous system

Here we repeat an example from [4]:

<pre class="mcode-input">rect = [-3.45 3.45 -4 3];
f = chebfun2(@(x,y) 2*y.*cos(y.^2).*cos(2*x) - cos(y), rect);
g = chebfun2(@(x,y) 2*sin(y.^2).*sin(2*x) - sin(x),rect);
tic, r = roots(f, g, 'resultant'); toc

plot(roots(f), 'r', LW, lw), hold on
plot(roots(g), 'b', LW, lw)
plot(r(:,1), r(:,2), 'k.', MS, ms)
axis(rect), axis equal, hold off</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Elapsed time is 10.561756 seconds.
</pre><img src="img/ResultantMethod_04.png" class="figure" alt="">



## Failure of Marching Squares

It is easy to derive a rootfinding problem that causes Marching Squares to fail. For instance, here is a problem where the two solutions are missed:

<pre class="mcode-input">d = [-.2 .2 -1 1];
f = chebfun2(@(x,y) (y - 5*x).*(y + 5*x), d);
g = chebfun2(@(x,y) 0.01*y - x + .0001, d);
r = roots(f, g, 'ms')

plot(roots(f), 'r', LW, lw), hold on
plot(roots(g), 'b', LW, lw), axis(d);
title('Marching Squares misses a solution',FS,fs)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">r =
     []
</pre><img src="img/ResultantMethod_05.png" class="figure" alt="">

We can compute the correct solutions by using the resultant method:

<pre class="mcode-input">r = roots(f, g, 'resultant');
plot(roots(f), 'r', LW, lw), hold on
plot(roots(g), 'b', LW, lw)
plot(r(:,1), r(:,2), 'k.', MS, ms), axis(d)
title('Resultant method finds the solution',FS,fs)</pre><img src="img/ResultantMethod_06.png" class="figure" alt="">
