<pre class="mcode-input">function ComplexRoots</pre>Poles and zeros of complex functions can be located by the evaluation of contour integrals, as mentioned in [Chapter 5](../../docs/guide/guide5.html) of the [Chebfun Guide](../../docs/guide/). For example, suppose we have a function like this one with a single root $s_1$ in the unit disk:

<pre class="mcode-input">ff = @(z) (z-0.5i).*exp(z);</pre>We can find the root as the value of a contour integral around the unit circle: $$ s = \frac{1}{2i\pi} \int z \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz. $$

Since Chebfun works with real independent variables, we parametrize the unit circle by a real variable $t$ on $[-1,1]$:

<pre class="mcode-input">z = chebfun('exp(1i*pi*t)');</pre>which gives us $$ s_1 = \frac{1}{2i\pi} \int z \frac{(df/dt)(dt/dz)}{f} \frac{dz}{dt} dt $$ $$ \phantom{s_1} = \frac{1}{2i\pi} \int z \frac{(df/dt)}{f} dt. $$

So here is the Chebfun evaluation:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = ff(z);
s1 = sum(z.*diff(f)./f)/(2i*pi)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">s1 =
 -0.000000000000003 + 0.500000000000002i
</pre>There is nothing in this computation that depends on the use of the unit disk. Other contours are equally tracatable in Chebfun, as illustrated in the Example [complex/KeyholeContour](../complex/KeyholeContour.html) and in [Chapter 5](../../docs/guide/guide5.html) of the Chebfun Guide.

This method of finding a single root goes back at least to McCune in 1966 [4]. In practice we would often want to be able to find multiple roots, and a generalized algorithm for this case was published by Delves and Lyness in 1967 [2], with mathematical origins as far back as Jackson in 1917 [3].  For a discussion of all kinds of related algorithms, see [1].  The idea here is that if $f$ has more than one root in the unit disk, then the value $s$ above comes out as the sum of all these roots.  Similarly

$$ s_2 = \frac{1}{2i\pi} \int z^2 \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz $$

is the sum of the squares of the roots, the analogous formula for $s_3$ with a factor $z^3$ gives the sum of the cubes, and so on.  And a count of the number of roots is given by

$$ s_0 = \frac{1}{2i\pi} \int \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz $$

(this is basically the argument principle).  So for example we can count the number of roots of $\cosh(\pi z)$ in the unit disk like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">ff = @(z) cosh(pi*z);
f = ff(z);
s0 = sum(diff(f)./f)/(2i*pi)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">s0 =
  2.000000000000000 - 0.000000000000000i
</pre>Here are the sum of the roots and the sum of their squares:

<pre class="mcode-input">s1 = sum(z.*diff(f)./f)/(2i*pi)
s2 = sum(z.^2.*diff(f)./f)/(2i*pi)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">s1 =
      4.330727237839987e-20 - 1.370796878478212e-17i
s2 =
 -0.499999999999999 + 0.000000000000000i
</pre>corresponding to roots at $\pm 0.5i$. We can find these numbers systematically by noting that the monic polynomial $p(z)$ with these roots has coefficients $c_0 = (s_1^2-s_2)/2$, $c_1=-s_1$, $c_2=1$. So here is a calculation of the two roots in the unit disk of $\cosh(\pi z)$:

<pre class="mcode-input">p = [1 -s1 (s1^2-s2)/2];
roots(p)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
 -0.000000000000000 - 0.499999999999999i
  0.000000000000000 + 0.499999999999999i
</pre>Generalization to higher numbers of roots can be done via Newton's identities. We don't pursue the general case here but instead write a code that finds three roots of an analytic function in the unit disk:

<pre class="mcode-input">function r = roots3(ff)    % find 3 roots of ff in unit disk
z = chebfun('exp(1i*pi*t)');
f = ff(z);
s0 = sum(diff(f)./f)/(2i*pi);
s1 = sum(z.*diff(f)./f)/(2i*pi);
s2 = sum(z.^2.*diff(f)./f)/(2i*pi);
s3 = sum(z.^3.*diff(f)./f)/(2i*pi);
p = [1 -s1 (s1^2-s2)/2 -(s1^3-3*s1*s2+2*s3)/6];
r = roots(p);
end</pre>Here is an example, this time with a phase portrait to visually verify the roots:

<pre class="mcode-input">ff = @(z) cosh(exp(z)).*(z-.3).*(1+4*z.^2);
roots3(ff)
plot(chebfun2(ff)), hold on
plot(z, 'k-'), axis equal</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
 -0.000000000000000 + 0.500000000000000i
  0.000000000000000 - 0.499999999999999i
  0.299999999999999 - 0.000000000000000i
</pre><img src="img/ComplexRoots_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

Here is another:

<pre class="mcode-input">ff = @(z) (z.^3-1/8).*exp((-1-2i)*z);
roots3(ff)
plot(chebfun2(ff)), hold on
plot(z, 'k-'), axis equal</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
 -0.250000000000002 + 0.433012701892223i
  0.500000000000001 + 0.000000000000005i
 -0.249999999999994 - 0.433012701892219i
</pre><img src="img/ComplexRoots_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

<pre class="mcode-input">end</pre>
