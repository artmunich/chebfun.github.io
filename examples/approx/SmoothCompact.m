% How do you make a smooth function with compact support?
% Ben Green tells me his favorite method is as follows.  Given $h>0$,
% consider a square wave of width $h$ and height $1/h$:
p = @(h) chebfun(1/h,[-h/2 h/2]);

%%
% Now convolve a few of these together with diminishing
% values of $h$, like this:
f = p(1);
for k = 3:5
  f = conv(f,p(2^-k));
end
LW = 'linewidth';
plot(f,LW,1.6), grid on
axis([-1 1 -.2 1.2])

%%
% This function was constructed from three convolutions, 
% so it will be of class $C^2$, with integral equal to 1:
sum(f)

%%
% By taking more and more terms, we can have any finite degree
% of smoothness, and an infinite convolution gives us
% a function in $C^\infty$.  It will have compact support 
% of the sum of the values of $h$ is funite.

%%
% This gives a nice way to construct partitions of unity.  For 
% example, here is the function above padded by zero values to the interval
% $[-1,2]$, and the same function shifted one unit to the right:
[a,b] = domain(f);
f1 = chebfun({0, f, 0},[-1 a b 2]);
f2 = chebfun({0, newDomain(f,[a+1,b+1]), 0}, [-1 a+1 b+1 2]);
plot(f1,'b',f2,'g',LW,1.6), grid on, axis([-1 2 -.2 1.2])

%%
% Adding up such functions gives us unity:
g = f1 + f2;
plot(g,'m',LW,1.6), grid on, axis([-1 2 -.2 1.2])

%%
% Constructions like this (both finite and infinite convolutions)
% have various applications, and among other things they are
% related to the _Denjoy-Carleman theorem_ [1,2].
