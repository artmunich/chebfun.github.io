Chebfun's `remez` command, written by Ricardo Pachon, can compute best (i.e. infinity-norm or minimax) approximations of a real function on a real interval. For example, here is an absolute value function on $[-1,1]$ and its best approximation by a polynomial of degree $10$:

<pre class="mcode-input">x = chebfun('x');
f = abs(x-0.5);
[p,err] = remez(f,10);
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize'; fs = 14;
figure, plot(f,'b',p,'r',LW,1.6)

Here is the error curve, with 12 points of equioscillation:

<pre class="mcode-input">figure, plot(f-p,LW,1.6), hold on
plot([-1 1],err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
plot([-1 1],-err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
ylim([-.05 .05])

In Chebfun Version 3, `remez` could only compute polynomial approximations [1], but Version 4 introduced some capabilities with rational approximations too.  For example, here is the error curve for type $(5,5)$ best rational approximation of the same function `f`, plotted on the same scale.  Note that there are again 12 points of equioscillation, but this time, they are more closely clustered near the singularity.

<pre class="mcode-input">[p,q,rh,err] = remez(f,5,5);
hold off, plot(f-p./q,LW,1.6), hold on
plot([-1 1],err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
plot([-1 1],-err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
ylim([-.05 .05])
title('Type (5,5) rational error curve',FS,fs)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Warning: Remez algorithm did not converge after 20 iterations to the tolerance
1.1e-14. 
</pre><img src="img/BestApprox_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

For an introduction to the theory of these approximations, see Chapters 10 and 24 of [3].

For rational approximation, Chebfun's `remez` command is currently not very robust.  An often better alternative is CF approximation; see [2] and the Chebfun `cf` command.
