For many years MATLAB has had a `gallery` command to construct interesting matrices.  Beginning with the release of Version 5.1 this month, Chebfun has a gallery command too, which constructs interesting functions, i.e., chebfuns. To see what's available, type `help cheb/gallery`.

Here is a particularly attractive image.  The command

<pre class="mcode-input">f = cheb.gallery('rose');</pre>produces a complex chebfun `f` that can be visualized strikingly with `fill`:

<pre class="mcode-input">fill(real(f),imag(f),[1 0 0]), axis equal off</pre><img src="img/Galleries_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

Some gallery examples produce results so simple that a line of obvious Chebfun code would have had the same effect:

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(cheb.gallery('airy')), ylim([-.6 .6]), title('Airy function')</pre><img src="img/Galleries_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

(This is essentially just `chebfun(@airy, [-40,40])`.) Sometimes however you may know what the function looks like but need a reminder of how to generate it.  Here is a polynomial of degree 10,000:

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(cheb.gallery('zigzag'),'m'), ylim([-.13 .09])
title('polynomial of degree 10,000')</pre><img src="img/Galleries_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

The gallery also includes a familiar Chebfun motto,

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(cheb.gallery('motto'),'k','linewidth',1.6)
axis equal off</pre><img src="img/Galleries_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

For periodic functions, there is also `cheb.gallerytrig`. (Two-dimensional functions and `cheb.gallery2` are discussed in a separate Example.) For example, here is an approximation to a fractal function of Weierstrass,

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(cheb.gallerytrig('weierstrass'),'linewidth',1,'color',[0 .6 0])</pre><img src="img/Galleries_05.png" class="figure" alt="">

Here is a periodic example whose function is generated by solving the periodic differential equation

$$ u'' + u' + 600(1+\sin x) u = 1, \qquad x\in[-\pi,\pi] . $$

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(cheb.gallerytrig('tsunami'),'color',[.8 .5 0]), ylim([-.2,.2])</pre><img src="img/Galleries_06.png" class="figure" alt="">

To find details of how a gallery example is constructed, try e.g. `type cheb/gallery` or `edit cheb/gallery`.  We are always glad to see interesting new examples: if you have something to suggest, please get in touch!
