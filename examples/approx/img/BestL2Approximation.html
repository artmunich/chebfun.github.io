## Least-squares approximation

If $f:[-1,1]\rightarrow R$ is an $L^2$-integrable function, then its least-squares or best $L^2$ approximation of degree $n$ is the polynomial $p_n$ of degree at most $n$ such that

$$ \| f - p_n \|_2 = \mbox{minimum}. $$

A good introduction to $L^2$ approximations can be found in [2]. The `polyfit` command in Chebfun returns the best $L^2$ approximation of a given degree to a chebfun:

<pre class="mcode-input">help chebfun/polyfit</pre><pre class="mcode-output"> POLYFIT   Fit polynomial to a CHEBFUN.
    F = POLYFIT(Y, N) returns a CHEBFUN F corresponding to the polynomial of
    degree N that fits the CHEBFUN Y in the least-squares sense.
 
    If Y is a global polynomial of degree n then this code has an O(n (log n)^2)
    complexity. If Y is piecewise polynomial then it has an O(n^2) complexity.
 
    F = POLYFIT(X, Y, N, D), where D is a DOMAIN object, returns a CHEBFUN F on
    the domain D which corresponds to the polynomial of degree N that fits the
    data (X, Y) in the least-squares sense. X should be a real-valued column
    vector and Y should be a matrix with size(Y,1) = size(X,1).
    
    F = POLYFIT(Y, N) where Y is represented as a periodic TRIGFUN object
    returns the degree N trigonometric polynomial fit of length 2N+1.
 
    Note CHEBFUN/POLYFIT does not not support more than one output argument in
    the way that MATLAB/POLYFIT does.

</pre>The coefficients of $p_n$ in the Legendre basis can be computed by truncating the Legendre expansion for $f$ after $n+1$ terms. For example,

<pre class="mcode-input">n = 5; x = chebfun('x');
f = abs(x);
P = legpoly(0:n,[-1,1],'norm');         % Legendre-Vandermonde matrix
cleg = P'*f;                            % compute Legendre coefficients
pn = P*cleg;                            % form chebfun of best L^2 approximation
plot(f,LW,lw), hold on, plot(pn,'r',LW,lw)
title('Best L^2 approximation to |x| of degree 5','fontsize',16), hold off</pre><img src="img/BestL2Approximation_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

This approach works well, but requires $O(n^2)$ operations to compute the Legendre coefficients with a relatively large constant. This was the algorithm using in Chebfun's `polyfit` command for many years, but was changed last week.



## `polyfit` using fast Chebyshev-Legendre transform

Recently, the command `cheb2leg` was added in Chebfun, which converts a vector of Chebyshev coefficients (of the first kind) to Legendre coefficients in $O(n(\log n)^2/\log\log n)$ operations [1,3]. The command `leg2cheb` is its inverse. To compute the Legendre expansion of a function (accurate to machine precision) we can first compute its Chebyshev expansion and then use `cheb2leg`. Chebfun already computes the Chebyshev expansion of a function that is accurate to machine precision. Therefore, here is another way to compute the best approximation of a smooth function via `cheb2leg`:

<pre class="mcode-input">n = 10;
f = 1./(1+25*x.^2);                  % Runge function
ccheb = chebcoeffs(f);               % get the Chebyshev coefficients of f
cleg = cheb2leg(ccheb);              % convert Cheb coeffs of f to Leg coeffs
cleg = cleg(1:(n+1));                % truncate
ccheb = leg2cheb(cleg);              % convert them back to form a chebfun
pn = chebfun(ccheb,'coeffs');        % form a chebfun
plot(f,LW,lw), hold on, plot(pn,'r',LW,lw)
title('Best L^2 approx to Runge function of degree 10',FS,14), hold off</pre><img src="img/BestL2Approximation_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

This is the algorithm that is used in Chebfun's `polyfit`, as of today. So we can obtain the same result from the code:

<pre class="mcode-input">n = 10;
f = 1./(1+25*x.^2);                  % Runge function
pn = polyfit(f,n);
plot(f,LW,lw), hold on, plot(pn,'r',LW,lw)

## High-degree best $L^2$ approximation for smooth functions

The fast algorithms now employed by `polyfit` enable us to compute very high degree $L^2$ approximations.

<pre class="mcode-input">n = 1e4;
f = 1./(1+1e6*x.^2);                 % Runge function
s = tic; pn = polyfit(f,n); t = toc(s);
fprintf('L^2 error is %1.3e\n',norm(f - pn))
fprintf('L^2 approximation of degree %u in t = %1.3f\n',n,t)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">L^2 error is 1.797e-06
L^2 approximation of degree 10000 in t = 0.995
</pre>

## Piecewise smooth functions

Computing the Legendre coefficients for piecewise smooth functions is a little trickier. The Legendre coefficients are computed by quadrature rules and then a chebfun object is constructed via Chebyshev coefficients computed using the `cheb2leg` command. The algorithm for piecewise smooth function requires $O(n^2)$ operations, but the implicit constant is much smaller. Here is the best $L^2$-approximation to the piecewise smooth absolute value function.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = abs(x);
nn = 10.^(0:3);
j=1;
for n = nn
    pn = polyfit(f, n);
    err(j) = norm(f - pn);
    j = j+1;
end

loglog(nn, err,'k.-',LW,lw,MS,24), hold on
loglog(nn,nn.^(-3/2),'k--',LW,lw)
