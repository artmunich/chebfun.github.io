Suppose you have a function $f$ on an interval:

<pre class="mcode-input">x = chebfun('x');
f = @(x) x.*sin(2*exp(2*sin(2*exp(2*x))));
fc = chebfun(f);
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize'; MS = 'markersize';
figure, plot(fc,LW,1.2)
title('Function f',FS,16)</pre><img src="img/GaussClenCurt_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

In Chebfun you would normally compute the integral like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">format long
Ichebfun = sum(fc)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Ichebfun =
   0.336732834781728
</pre>Chebfun's method is Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature, i.e., the integration of the polynomial representing $f$ by interpolation or piecewise interpolation in Chebyshev points. Here is the number of quadrature points:

<pre class="mcode-input">Npts = length(fc)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Npts =
   659
</pre>If we wanted, we could also perform the integration by explicitly extracting the Clenshaw-Curtis nodes and weights, like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">[s,w] = chebpts(Npts);
Iclenshawcurtis = w*f(s)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Iclenshawcurtis =
   0.336732834781727
</pre>Or we could try Gauss quadrature with the same number of points and weights.

<pre class="mcode-input">[s,w] = legpts(Npts);
Igauss = w*f(s)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Igauss =
   0.336732834781728
</pre>Though this value of `Npts` is in the hundreds, Chebfun can handle values in the millions without difficulty. This is achieved by the algorithm of Hale and Townsend [1]. See the Example [quad/GaussQuad](../quad/GaussQuad.html).

Let's take a look at the accuracy as a function of `Npts`. Gauss quadrature converges geometrically, since $f$ is analytic ([1], Theorem 19.3).

<pre class="mcode-input">figure, tic, err = [];
NN = 10:10:500;
for Npts = NN
  [s,w] = legpts(Npts);
  Igauss = w*f(s);
  err = [err abs(Igauss-Ichebfun)];
end
semilogy(NN,err,'.-',LW,1,MS,16), grid on
ylim([1e-18 1])
xlabel('Npts',FS,12), ylabel('Error',FS,12)
title('Gauss quadrature convergence',FS,16), toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Elapsed time is 0.333560 seconds.
</pre><img src="img/GaussClenCurt_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

Let's add another curve to the plot for Clenshaw-Curtis:

<pre class="mcode-input">hold on, tic, err = [];
for Npts = NN
  [s,w] = chebpts(Npts);
  Iclenshawcurtis = w*f(s);
  err = [err abs(Iclenshawcurtis-Ichebfun)];
end
semilogy(NN,err,'.-r',LW,1,MS,16)
title('Gauss and Clenshaw-Curtis',FS,16)
legend('Gauss','Clenshaw-Curtis','location','southwest'), toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Elapsed time is 1.089475 seconds.
</pre><img src="img/GaussClenCurt_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature also converges geometrically for analytic functions ([1], Theorem 19.3). In some circumstances Gauss converges up to twice as fast as C-C, with respect to `Npts`, but as this example suggests, the two formulas are often closer than that.  The computer time is often faster with C-C. For details of the comparison, see [2], [4], and Chapter 19 of [3].
