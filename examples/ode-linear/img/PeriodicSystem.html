Chebfun can solve systems of ODEs with periodic boundary conditions. For example, consider the equations

$$ u - v' = 0, \qquad u'' + v = \cos(x) $$

on the interval $[-\pi, \pi]$ with periodic boundary conditions on $u$ and $v$. A Chebfun solution could be put together like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">d = [-pi,pi];
A = chebop(d);
A.op = @(x,u,v) [u-diff(v); diff(u,2)+v];
x = chebfun('x',d);
f = [0;cos(x)];
A.bc = 'periodic';
u = A\f</pre><pre class="mcode-output">u =
   2 x 1 chebmatrix of block types:
    'chebfun'
    'chebfun'
</pre>Because the boundardy conditions are periodic, the system of ODEs is solved with a Fourier collocation method, and the solution $u$ is represented by a Fourier series. (This is what `periodic` means in the display of $u$ above.) We plot the result:

<pre class="mcode-input">LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 2; FS = 'fontsize'; fs = 14;
plot(u,LW,lw), title('Solutions u and v',FS,fs), legend('u','v');</pre><img src="img/PeriodicSystem_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

For this problem, the solution can actually be computed analytically. How close were we?

<pre class="mcode-input">exact = [cos(x+3*pi/4) cos(x+pi/4)]/sqrt(2);
err = max([norm(u{1}-exact(:,1),inf) norm(u{2}-exact(:,2),inf)])</pre><pre class="mcode-output">err =
     8.207219039300378e-14
</pre>We show this also works for piecewise problems by artificially introducing a breakpoint at the origin.

<pre class="mcode-input">A.domain = [-pi,0,pi];
u = A\f</pre><pre class="mcode-output">u =
   2 x 1 chebmatrix of block types:
    'chebfun'
    'chebfun'
</pre>The solution is now represented by a Chebyshev series, and the equation has been solved with a Chebyshev collocation method, because Fourier collocation methods don't work with breakpoints.

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(u,LW,lw), title('Solutions u and v',FS,fs), legend('u','v');
err = max([norm(u{1}-exact(:,1),inf) norm(u{2}-exact(:,2),inf)])</pre><pre class="mcode-output">err =
