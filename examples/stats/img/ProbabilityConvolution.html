<pre class="mcode-input">LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize'; MS = 'markersize';</pre>It is well known that the probability distribution of the sum of two or more independent random variables is the convolution of their individual distributions, defined by

$$ h(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) g(x-t) dt. $$

Many standard distributions have simple convolutions, and here we investigate some of them before computing the convolution of some more exotic distributions.



## Normal distribution

The normal distribution has the PDF

$$ f(x; \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}
e^{-(x-\mu)^2/2\sigma^2}. $$

Let's make an anonymous function that can compute it:

<pre class="mcode-input">normalDist = @(x, mu, s) exp(-.5*(x-mu).^2/s^2) / (s*sqrt(2*pi));</pre>Now let's make two normal distributions with differing parameters, `N1` as $N(\mu_1, \sigma_1)$ and `N2` as $N(\mu_2, \sigma_2)$. To make things easier, we'll truncate to a finite domain.

<pre class="mcode-input">dom = [-1.2 1.2];
x = chebfun('x', dom);

s1 = .1; m1 = .1;
N1 = normalDist(x, m1, s1);

s2 = .11; m2 = -.3;
N2 = normalDist(x, m2, s2);</pre>We can compute the distribution of the sum of two variables drawn from these distributions by convolving `N1` and `N2`:

<pre class="mcode-input">N3 = conv(N1, N2);
plot(N1, 'b', N2 ,'r', N3, 'k', LW, 1.6), set(gca, FS, 14)
xlim([-1.5 1.5])</pre><img src="img/ProbabilityConvolution_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

One can show (see, for example, [1]) that `N3` should be equal to $N(\mu_1+\mu_2, \sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2)$. Let us verify this:

<pre class="mcode-input">N4 = normalDist(x, m1 + m2, sqrt(s1^2 + s2^2));
norm(N4 - N3{dom(1), dom(2)})</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
     2.170603001670892e-14
</pre>

## Gamma distribution

We next consider the gamma distribution, which has the PDF

$$ f(x, k, \theta) = \frac{x^{k-1}e^{-x/\theta}}
{\theta^k\Gamma(k)}, \quad x\ge0. $$

As before, let's compute the distribution for the sum of two variables drawn from such distributions by using `conv`:

<pre class="mcode-input">gammaDist = @(x, k, t) x.^(k-1).*exp(-x./t) / (t^k*gamma(k));

dom = [0 5];
x = chebfun('x', dom);

k1 = 2; t = .3;
G1 = gammaDist(x, k1, t);

k2 = 1;
G2 = gammaDist(x, k2, t);

G3 = conv(G1, G2);
plot(G1, 'b', G2 ,'r', G3, 'k', LW, 1.6)
xlim([0 5])</pre><img src="img/ProbabilityConvolution_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

In this instance, we should have

$$ G(k_1, \theta) + G(k_2, \theta) = G(k_1 + k_2, \theta): $$

<pre class="mcode-input">G4 = gammaDist(x, k1 + k2, t);
norm(G4 - G3{dom(1), dom(2)})</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
     3.707027419276411e-14
</pre>

## Exponential distribution

As our final example of common distributions, let's look at the exponential distribution, which has the PDF

$$ f(x, \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x\ge0. $$

<pre class="mcode-input">dom = [0 40];
x = chebfun('x', dom);
expDist = @(x, lam) lam*exp(-lam*x);</pre>This time we make just a single distribution, $E(0.9)$, which we convolve with itself to give the distribution for the sum of two variables from $E(0.9)$.

<pre class="mcode-input">lam = .25;
E = expDist(x, lam);

E2 = conv(E, E);
plot(E, 'b', E2, 'k', LW, 1.6)
xlim([0 40])</pre><img src="img/ProbabilityConvolution_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

In this instance, the theory tells us we should have a gamma distribution, which indeed we do:

<pre class="mcode-input">E3 = gammaDist(x, 2, 1/lam);
norm(E3 - E2{dom(1), dom(2)})</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
     9.068184965180562e-16
</pre>

## Exotic distributions

Of course, the relationships verified above are available in closed form only for certain special cases. For more exotic distributions the convolution _must_ be computed numerically.

Let's do this for two exotic (and discontinuous) probability distributions, arbitrarily defined by summing a Heaviside function with a number of Gaussians and then normalising.

<pre class="mcode-input">rng('default')
x = chebfun('x', [-2 2]);
F = heaviside(x);
G = heaviside(.5-x);
for k = 1:10
    F = F + normalDist(x, randn, 2*rand);
    G = G + normalDist(x, randn, 2*rand);
end
F = F/sum(F);
G = G./sum(G);</pre>Here are the distributions themselves:

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(F,'b', G, 'r', LW, 1.6)
xlim([-4 4]);</pre><img src="img/ProbabilityConvolution_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

And this is the distribution of the random variable $z=x+y$, where $x$ is drawn from $F$ and $y$ is drawn from $G$:

<pre class="mcode-input">tic
h = conv(F, G);
toc
hold on, plot(h, 'k', LW, 1.6), hold off</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Elapsed time is 1.175249 seconds.
</pre><img src="img/ProbabilityConvolution_05.png" class="figure" alt="">
