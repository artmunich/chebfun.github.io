<pre class="mcode-input">function Histogram</pre>Suppose we have a chebfun, like this one:

<pre class="mcode-input">x = chebfun('x',[0,10]);
f = x/3 + cos(2*x) + .5*sin(x.^2) + .2*sin(27*x);
LW = 'linewidth';
plot(f,LW,1), hold on</pre><img src="img/Histogram_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

and we have some bins defined by bin edges, like these:

<pre class="mcode-input">edges = 0:10;</pre>and we want to 'bin' f into these bins.  Here is a "histogram" function that will do something along these lines.  In each bin, the value it stores is the total integral of f in that interval.

<pre class="mcode-input">function h = hist(f,edges)
    nbins = length(edges)-1;
    data = zeros(nbins,1);
    fsum = cumsum(f);
    for k = 1:nbins
        a = edges(k); b = edges(k+1);
        data(k) = fsum(b)-fsum(a);
    end
    h = chebfun(num2cell(data),edges);
end</pre>If we apply the function to our data, we get a histogram represented as a piecewise constant chebfun:

<pre class="mcode-input">h = hist(f,edges);
plot(h,'r',LW,2)</pre><img src="img/Histogram_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

What if we wanted to start from data points rather than a function? Chebfun would allow us to do this with delta functions, like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">npts = 50; xpts = 5+randn(npts,1);
f2 = 0*x;
for j = 1:npts
    f2 = f2 + dirac(x-xpts(j));
end
hold off
plot(xpts,0*xpts,'.k','markersize',10)
edges = 0:.5:10;
h = hist(f2,edges);
hold on, plot(h,'r',LW,2)
ylim([-1,max(h)+1])</pre><img src="img/Histogram_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

This is an extremely inefficient way to work with data, but it illustrates some of the ways in which chebfuns can be manipulated.

Perhaps an overload of Matlab's HIST command should be included in Chebfun?  Such an overload would certainly not use delta functions internally, and it would require some careful thinking about appropriate definitions.
